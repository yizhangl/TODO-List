# To-do List Application

## Proposal

A *bulleted* list:
- My application can *list things* to do, *cut completed* things off ,and it'll *remind* you of *upcoming* things.
- Students and workers who have **many tasks** to do and live a **messy** life prefer using this app.
- I plan to make this project because I want to **organize** my busy life.



## User Stories

A specific outcome:
- As a user, I want to be able to add a task to my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to view the list of tasks on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to mark a task as complete/incomplete on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to delete a task from my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to see the number of complete tasks, incomplete tasks and all tasks on my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to clear my to-do list
- As a user, I want to be able to save my to-do list to file
- As a user, I want to be able to load my to-do list from file

## Phase4: Task 3

- Add more abstract classes and interfaces to avoid duplicates
